### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Julien

Bored with my old job,

- ğŸ’¬ I decided to take the bull by the horns and started learning dev with O'clock in order to retrain professionally in 2022.
- ğŸ¤— It was a great experience where I learned HTML CSS JS PHP SQL ...
- ğŸ’– I am particularly attracted by the front end and especially React

- ğŸ‘¯ Now I'm very happy to be part of this great community and I'm looking forward to contribute to it.
