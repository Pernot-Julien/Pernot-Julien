### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Julien

Bored with my old job,

- 💬 I decided to take the bull by the horns and started learning dev with O'clock in order to retrain professionally in 2022.
- 🤗 It was a great experience where I learned HTML CSS JS PHP SQL ...
- 💖 I am particularly attracted by the front end and especially React

- 👯 Now I'm very happy to be part of this great community and I'm looking forward to contribute to it.
